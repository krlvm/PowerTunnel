### What is it
Nowadays Internet censorship is introducing in many countries: governments analyze and block traffic to this sites using DPI - Deep Packet Inspection systems, forcing you using circumvention utilities like VPN, for example. That approach have many disadvantages, most noticeable - connection speed slowdown. In addition, these services cannot guarantee work stability and your data confidence.

PowerTunnel is active DPI circumvention utility, that works only on your PC and don't send your traffic to third-party servers, respecting your privacy and do not slowing down your internet connection.

PowerTunnel is more than a regular anti-censorship utility - using it, you can monitor your traffic and block any connection, advertising, for example.

### How does it work?
PowerTunnel establishes a transparent proxy server on your PC and directs your traffic through it, applying DPI circumvention tricks.

PowerTunnel never decrypts your traffic, all code is open-source.\
You should install Root CA only in case you enabled [some specific options](https://github.com/krlvm/PowerTunnel/wiki/SNI-Tricks).

## How can I get it?
You can compile a binary yourself or download prepared binary [here](https://github.com/krlvm/PowerTunnel/releases).

### Setup
The installation process is described in detail [on the Wiki](https://github.com/krlvm/PowerTunnel/wiki/Installation).

### Doesn't work
Try to disable chunking mode and enable SNI Spoil.

Most likely your ISP blocked the website you need by IP address, so only encrypted tunnel (VPN/Tor) can help you.

## User interface
You can monitor network activity, block and whitelist websites through Java Swing-based user interface when console mode is off or through [PowerTunnel Monitor](https://github.com/krlvm/PowerTunnel/wiki/PowerTunnel-Monitor).

## Configuring PowerTunnel
### DNS over HTTPS
PowerTunnel supports DNS over HTTPS (DoH) - secure and fast DNS protocol.

DoH servers tested with PowerTunnel:
* Google (recommended):
  * https://dns.google/dns-query
  * https://8.8.8.8/dns-query
* Cloudflare - https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query (unstable)

You can test if you're using DoH [here](http://www.whatsmydnsserver.com/). If you have problems with DoH on PowerTunnel try disabling DNSSec mode.
