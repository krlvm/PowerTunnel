 You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 the conditions stated in this License.

 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

 incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

 * <p>
 * A ProxyConnection models a bidirectional message flow on top of a Netty
 * {@link Channel}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #read(Object)} method is called whenever a new message arrives on
 * the underlying socket.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #write(Object)} method can be called by anyone wanting to write
 * data out of the connection.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * ProxyConnection has a lifecycle and its current state within that lifecycle
 * is recorded as a {@link ConnectionState}. The allowed states and transitions
 * vary a little depending on the concrete implementation of ProxyConnection.
 * However, all ProxyConnections share the following lifecycle events:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #connected()} - Once the underlying channel is active, the
 * ProxyConnection is considered connected and moves into
 * {@link ConnectionState#AWAITING_INITIAL}. The Channel is recorded at this
 * time for later referencing.</li>
 * <li>{@link #disconnected()} - When the underlying channel goes inactive, the
 * ProxyConnection moves into {@link ConnectionState#DISCONNECTED}</li>
 * <li>{@link #becameWritable()} - When the underlying channel becomes
 * writeable, this callback is invoked.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * By default, incoming data on the underlying channel is automatically read and
 * passed to the {@link #read(Object)} method. Reading can be stopped and
 * resumed using {@link #stopReading()} and {@link #resumeReading()}.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <I>
 *            the type of "initial" message. This will be either
